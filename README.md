## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirilla/python.git
cd ./python
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Develop

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Pandemonium. (Stay safe. Use vi.)

deactivate
```


## Install

```bash
pip install .

# When doing a pip install in a virtual python environment, the venv,
# executables will be installed in venv/bin.
# If not using a venv you can add --user to force pip to install to a user-location.
# (The default is a systemwide location, which could be a bad idea. It depends.)
```

## Usage

```bash

### Fineprint
Look. About the code. Half of the code isn't mine. I nabbed it. Copy-pasted. ChatGPT wrote it. Does it matter? Sure it does. But who cares. Do YOU have a lawyer? 🕵🏻‍♂ 🚬 Yeah, I didn't think so.

I feel kinda stupid. 😩 But hey. At least the license is from MIT. 😏
